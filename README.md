**CLI Helpers**

I spend a lot of time on the command line and these things help me do that.

dirfor
Usage: ```dirfor <process name>```
Output: the current directories in use by the processes with the given name

git-to-vim
Usage: ```git-to-vim``` (from within a git repo)
Will open all currently modified files in your repo in Vim.
